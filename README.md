## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/user/xora-main.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd xora-main
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start a local development server, typically running at `http://localhost:3000`, where you can preview the landing page.

## Usage

To modify the landing page, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your preferred code editor (e.g., VSCode).
2. All source code for the app is located in the `src` directory.
3. The `App.jsx` file is the main entry point of the application. You can start editing this file to change the structure, layout, or content of the page.

### File Structure

- `src/components`: Contains all reusable React components (e.g., Header, HeroSection, Footer).
- `src/assets`: Stores static assets like images, icons, and fonts.
- `src/styles`: Contains the global and component-specific stylesheets.

## Deployment

To deploy the application to production:

1. Build the application:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command generates an optimized build of the application in the `dist/` directory.

2. Once the build process is complete, you can deploy the contents of the `dist/` directory to any static hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or your own web server).
